# leo-extras

This is a multi use resource that can be used for leo lighting patterns, civ extras with sounds, and many more. Unfortunately, the vehicle will still repair its self when using the keybinds to switch extras. There is no way to get around this as some extras require the vehicle to repair, and not doing so may lead to syncing issues. There is a option in the configuration area for disabling auto repair, but like I said before...this will break unless you dont use toggleable lightbars(where u can take them on or off) or if youre just using this for civ cars.

Please put any bugs, support questions, or support in the comments or simply join my development server. https://discord.gg/UuEjzRHpuS

To configure the script simply go into the client.lua and configure whats needed for you via the comments.

Coming Soon _maybe_
